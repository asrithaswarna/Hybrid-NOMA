# Version C Implementation Plan

## Existing architecture

Version C is a command-line Python project. `main.py` loads `config.yaml`, generates synthetic wireless network graphs with `DatasetGenerator.generate_split()`, trains `HybridNOMAGNN`, evaluates OMA/PD-NOMA/oracle/GNN methods with `NetworkEvaluator`, runs the separate SCMA detector experiment, and saves plots, CSV metrics, JSON metadata, and a PyTorch checkpoint.

The reusable core data structures are `UserChannelState`, `NetworkGraph`, `PairingPlan`, `NetworkScheduleResult`, and `MethodBenchmarkMetrics`. The current default data source is synthetic channel simulation. SCMA is currently evaluated separately from the PD-NOMA scheduler; this plan will preserve that honest scope.

## Planned modifications

### Stage 1: Data and lifecycle infrastructure
- Add `src/data_pipeline.py` for input validation, synthetic sample extraction, optional per-user CSV loading, feature engineering, and train/validation/test scenario splitting.
- Define and document a CSV schema based on `UserChannelState` fields. Validate file existence, required columns, numeric values, missing values, duplicate user IDs within scenarios, user counts, units, and ranges.
- Keep synthetic generation as the default and record data source metadata.
- Add reusable preprocessing fitted only on training data and reused for validation, test, and inference.

### Stage 2: Classical supervised models
- Add `src/classical_models.py` with a small, genuine regression task: predict simulated single-user achievable rate from validated channel/user features.
- Train and compare Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression on the same scenario-level split.
- Report MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2; save model artifacts and feature importance for tree models.
- Keep this task separate from the GNN pairing objective and label the comparison accordingly.

### Stage 3: Unsupervised analysis
- Add `src/unsupervised.py` with standardized user/channel features, K-means, DBSCAN, and PCA.
- Save assignments, PCA explained variance, cluster summaries, and plots.
- Compare clusters descriptively with GNN/near-far pairing without claiming that clustering is optimal scheduling.

### Stage 4: Evaluation and CLI workflow
- Add consistent model-comparison reports containing model, task, split, source, seed, metrics, and timing.
- Extend the CLI with `--mode train|evaluate|inference|clustering|compare|retrain`, `--data-source synthetic|csv`, and `--dataset` while preserving existing commands.
- Keep presentation and detailed output modes. Ensure final summary metrics come from the same identified evaluation result.

### Stage 5: ML engineering
- Add model save/load and inference helpers for classical artifacts and the existing GNN checkpoint.
- Add lightweight JSON/CSV monitoring for prediction count, invalid inputs, latency, and feature/prediction summaries.
- Add a retraining workflow that evaluates a candidate against the existing artifact and reports acceptance rather than silently replacing a model.
- Add an optional FastAPI API with `/health`, `/model-info`, and `/predict`. The normal experiment command will not start the service.

### Stage 6: Documentation and tests
- Update README, data schema documentation, methodology, limitations, experiment protocol, B.Tech report guide, presentation guide, and viva answers.
- Add tests for CSV validation, preprocessing consistency, classical models, clustering, metric consistency, packaging, monitoring, and API behavior where dependencies are available.
- Run existing tests, new tests, compile checks, synthetic workflow, CSV workflow, compare, clustering, inference, and API smoke checks.

## Known limitations

- The current GNN evaluates PD-NOMA pair scheduling; SCMA remains a separate detector experiment and is not silently presented as integrated scheduling.
- Classical models predict a clearly defined simulated user-rate target and are not claimed to replace the GNN pairing model.
- CSV support will require a complete per-user scenario schema and does not turn synthetic results into real-world validation.
- FastAPI and scikit-learn are optional runtime dependencies; core GNN/NOMA execution should remain usable when optional analysis features are not installed.
- Monitoring is local lightweight logging, not production observability.
